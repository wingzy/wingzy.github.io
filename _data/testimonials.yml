    Wingzy is a quantum leap for Bouygues. It is the first time that everyone can find skills and knowledge throughout the group.<br/>
    We chose this solution because it is a simple, direct, intuitive and readable tool to help our teams connect in 2 clicks.<br/>
    We are now deploying Wingzy, which fully meets our expectations, to 2,000 group employees.

    I found the profile creation very easy, fast and intuitive. In less than 5 minutes, the profile is pretty much complete.<br/>
    Searching for users is also very easy, and with a click we have a good idea of their profile. So useful to be able to find people by entities/teams.<br/>
    In conclusion, I love Wingzy!
